# User-Comment-Analysis
In this project, I led a group of 6 student to implement knowledge in NLP to process user comments for Roku Ultra on Amazon and Twitter. We applied methods such as LDA, random forest, sentiment analysis and ANOVA to investigate, and generated data-supported business  insight. This repo shares the data, the presentation, and the code I personally wrote for this project.
